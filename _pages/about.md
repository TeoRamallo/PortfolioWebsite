title: About
subtitle: I am a recent graduate with a masterâ€™s in Game Art from Escape Studios, specializing in creating immersive and detailed environments. I have hands-on experience with industry-standard tools such as Maya for 3D modeling, Substance Painter and Quixel Mixer for texturing, and Unreal Engine 5 for developing high-quality, optimized environments. My focus is on delivering visually compelling and efficient assets for game development.
