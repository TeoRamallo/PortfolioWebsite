The concept of my final project is to research the question of why music evokes memories. To do this, I will be studying Alzheimer's disease and researching music therapy, which helps even people with the least memory to still recall memories. I will also be exploring how music can be visually represented through sound waves and researching synesthesia, a condition where people see music visually. I will also study the emotions that music evokes, as these trigger memories.

In addition, I will explore different ways of creating visual art, such as through After Effects, coding, and physical art (drawing, painting, collage). Two artists that I will be researching are Joelle Snaith and Joshua Davis.

Through my research and artist research, I decided to use code as my medium. This will allow me to create code that reads a chosen song and generates a unique visual representation of it. I will explore this method and create several pieces, ultimately choosing one. I will also use After Effects to add further effects to my final piece and consider combining all of them into one video. Throughout the process, I will document my progress in my sketchbook and journal, showcasing the steps I took to create these visuals and what I learned about code and After Effects.

Visiting the Tate and Saatchi galleries provided insights into different ways of setting up moving image pieces, which has helped me in deciding how I want to present my project.
