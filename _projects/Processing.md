The concept of my final project is to research the question that I have chosen which is, why does music evoke memories? To do so I will be researching Alzheimerâ€™s and looking into music therapy, and how this type of therapy helps even the people with least memory to be able to still grab onto memories. Will also be researching how music can be shown visually through soundwaves and will also research synesthesia as this is a condition which people see music visually. Aswell as emotions that music evokes as this is what triggers the memories. I will also be looking into different ways of creating visual art such as through after effects, coding, and physical art (drawing, painting, collage). Two of the artists I will research are Joelle Snaith and Joshua Davis.

Through my research and artist research I was able to decide what medium I want to use which is code, as this allows me to create code which reads the song of choice and generates a moving image visual. Since it creates a unique visual for every song it is never the same outcome. I am going to explore this and create several pieces and choose one. I will also be using after effects to add other
effects towards my final piece and might think of putting them all together as one video. Throughout the process I will be using my sketchbook and journal to show the steps I took to create these visuals and show what I have learnt about code and after effects.

Visiting the Tate and Saatchi I saw ways of setting up moving image pieces in different ways and has helped me in the process of deciding how I would want to set it up when it comes to it.
