I am currently working on a scene for a project set in an abandoned warehouse at night. The main theme involves ghosts haunting the character as they move around. This is a practice exercise to create a dark atmosphere where the character relies solely on a flashlight to illuminate their surroundings, creating an eerie experience for the player.
