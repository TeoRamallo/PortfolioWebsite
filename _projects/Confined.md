The main focus of the video is to showcase the spaces that I am currently restricted to due to lockdown. Rather than using video footage, I opted for 3D scans to depict these spaces. The reason behind this choice is that, with people worldwide being confined to their homes, we are now limited to experiencing public spaces and other locations through digital screens. Therefore, I wanted to leverage the capabilities of modern technology, which allow us to render images and bring them from reality into a fictional world. Since we can already see everything around us through our own eyes, I aimed to show what I see every day, but through the lens of technology.
