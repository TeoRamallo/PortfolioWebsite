The main focus of the video is to show the spaces I am now restricted to because of lockdown. I wanted to show the spaces I am confinded to but not through video itself but through 3D scans, the reason for choosing to do so through 3D scans is because as everyone is in lockdown around the world we are now restricted to view other spaces and public spaces through the lense of a digital screen, and I wanted to take advantage of what our technology allows us to do nowadays which is to render images and bring them from reality into a fictional world. Since we can already see everything around us through our own eyes, I wanted to show what I see everyday but through the eyes of technology.
